                #Formulas Used: 
                        # 1 => C = 1 assumes first coordinate is always a window chair
                        # columnSize=> takes the last column coordinate as an aisle chair
                        # max_columnSize =>assumes that max_columnSize is the current last column
                        # (@total_column + 1) => @total_column + 1 give the coordinate of the first chair
                        # (@total_column + 2)  => Used to indicate the chair next to the aisle
                        # (max_columnSize - 1) => generate the last chair before the current last column
